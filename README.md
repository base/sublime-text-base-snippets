# Base Snippets

Sublime Text snippets for [Base](https://github.com/node-base/base).

## Getting Started

**Heads up!** Until this is registered with package control, you'll need to [install manually](#manual-installation).

### 1. Installation

#### Package Control

If you already have [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/) installed in Sublime Text:

* Select "Install Package" from the Command Palette: <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd> on Windows and Linux or <kbd>⇧⌘P</kbd> on OS X)
* Search for "**Base Snippets**" and click <kbd>enter</kbd>.

#### Manual Installation

Go to `Preferences -> Browse Packages`, and then either download and unzip this plugin into that directory, or:

git clone https://github.com/node-base/sublime-text-snippets-base.git
